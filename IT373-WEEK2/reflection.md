    I had a lot of trouble at first when I was putting up my website and trying to create a about page.  Determining how base.html relates to home.html and about.html was difficult for me. I occasionally neglected to include the proper {% block %} and {% extends %} tags, which resulted in errors that I didn't immediately comprehend.  Due to Django's initial inability to locate my templates folder, I also experienced issues with the file paths.  I became frustrated and stuck as a result. 
    I also had difficulties with views.py and urls.py.  I typed the incorrect URL path or neglected to return the template in the view, among other minor issues.  I had to constantly check my code because every little error prevented the page from loading correctly.  Although it was hard, I began to understand how rigid Django's grammar and structure are.
    I eventually saw my About Page, which extended from base.html, displayed correctly after much trial and error.  I was happy of myself at that moment since I realized how template inheritance makes the design consistent and saves time.  Overall, I learned patience, caution, and the importance of meticulous debugging from the experience.
